## Vault Block

This block shows a medium implementation of a block. The texture of the container was retrived from the [iron chest mod](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev/IronChest/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/ironchest/textures/entity/chest/obsidian_chest.png). This container has a key on the right and a code on the left. Once the key has been filled in, it will be hidden. Furthermore, the contents of the container will not be visible or accessible unless the code is input to match the key. The key cannot be changed until the code is correct. Recipe:
